# Na2test.
Code test for Not awesome 2.
Check the Na2 file to see hows the script works.

# REMINDER

To know if the script is finished or not, you could ask me. My discord is Otiz#8020

# HOW TO USE SCRIPT?
1. Copy the script on the Na2 folder and go to https://pastebin.com
2. Paste the script and click "Click New Paste"
